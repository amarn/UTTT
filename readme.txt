====================
This is final project in AI course at HUJI (winter 2013/24).
Authors: Adi Ben Binyamin & Eran Amar.
Subject: Adversarial Search - Minimax and optimizations.

We explored the Utlimate-Tic-Tac-Toe game, and implemented 
several AI agents.
Our project focused on implementation of different evaluation functions 
and unique optimization combined with Minimax (in addition to the 
classic optimizaion as Alph-Beta pruning).

Usage: python uttt_game_engine.py <arg1> <arg2>
